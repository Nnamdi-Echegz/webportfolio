        Hello, my name is Nnamdi Echegini and I recentnly graduated from studying Computer Programming at Algonquin College.
        Among the Languages and technologies I've learnt and used soo far include; Java, Python, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, XML, 
        My SQL, MS SQL, MS Access, Oracle, Windows and Linux. I have been able to use Eclipse and NetBeans for Java programming, 
        Ubuntu for Linux (command lines and shell scripting) and Android Studio for Mobile Graphical Interface Programming.
        I also have a 4 year learning experience in Statistics, a course I studied in the University while in my home country.
        During the period I was able to gain knowledge on various statistical methodologies. While on field projects 
        I conducted surveys, made analysis and drew conclusions out of the data gathered. I was able to gain experience
        with Statistics, Data analysis and Data visualization packages such as SPSS, R-Studio, Stata, Tableau and Microsoft Excel from the above mentioned field projects.
        I find communication technologies quite intriguing and hence quite a percentage of my hobbies include things around these tecnologies. I also enjoy
        cooking(mostly african delicasies), watching movies(I tend to stay away from series because they make me pretty engrossed and lazy), cylcing
        and going to the gym. I am an automobile enthusiast and find myself binge watching youtube videos on different 
        cars(mostly hyper-cars) and their specs. When I am not doing any of these, I love to go on social media and watch comedy skits, 
        connect with my family and friends and other times, reflect on my life and see how I can contribute better to the society.
        </p>
